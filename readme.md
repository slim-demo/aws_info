### aws_info.sh - Generates json containing aws information

This program runs in two scripts. The first one is a shell script that queries AWS using the [AWS CLI interface](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html). You need to install the AWS CLI software following the instructions in that link. It also requires the proper IAM configuration to be set. This was the policy set in IAM, and although the permissions are very broad, it is only for demonstration purposes:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1429508992000",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1429509020000",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "rds:*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1429509057000",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "elasticache:*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1429509066000",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudformation:*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1429509067000",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "elasticloadbalancing:*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Once that is setup, and the proper AWS Keys and AWS secret is in place, the aws_info.sh will generate JSON containing all the AWS requested information. It is executed by running `./aws_info.sh`. 

A sample output was included in **aws_info.json.sample**.

### generate_html - Python script that generates HTML using the JSON generated by aws_info.sh

The second part of this program is the **generate_html.sh** script. This is a script generated in Python that calls the **aws_info.sh** and uses the generated JSON to create a more human readable version in HTML. 

This uses the python library [json2html](https://github.com/softvar/json2html). This needs to be downloaded, uncompressed and installed by going into the extracted json2html-0.3 directory and running `python setup.py install`. 

The script was tested using _Python 2.7.5_

Once those prerequisites are met it can be run by executing `./generate_html.sh` and it will generate an **index.html** file

This file can be viewed in a web browser or can be added to a web server for remote viewing.

Sample files were also included named **index.html.sample** and **index.html.sample2**.
